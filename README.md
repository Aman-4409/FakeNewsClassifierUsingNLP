# FakeNewsClassifierUsingNLP
The project involves the following steps:
 Data collection: Collect a large dataset of news articles, both real and fake. This dataset
should be diverse and cover a wide range of topics.
 Data preprocessing: Preprocess the data by cleaning and formatting the text. This step
involves removing any unwanted characters, stop words, and stemming or
lemmatizing the words.
 Feature extraction: Extract meaningful features from the preprocessed text using
techniques such as Bag of Words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document
Frequency (TF-IDF), and Word Embeddings.
 Model selection: Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm for the
classification task. Possible options include Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support
Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks.
 Model training: Train the selected model using the extracted features and labeled data.
 Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using metrics such
as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
 Model deployment: Deploy the trained model as an application or service that can
classify news articles in real-time.
